This project is a assignment for course ECCS2681 - DSA 2. The goal for this project is to write code that Stores graph information in bot ha adjacency matrix and adjacency list. This is a relatively simple project that will help me understand how to work with graphs in C++, and improve my skills with data structures and algorithms.
