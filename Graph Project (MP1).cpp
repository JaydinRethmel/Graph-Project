// Title - Graph Project (MP1)
// Author - Jaydin Rethmel
// Description - This project is a assignment for course ECCS2681 - Data Structures and Algorithms 2. The goal for this project is to write code that
//               Stores graph information in bot ha adjacency matrix and adjacency list. This is a relatively simple project that will help me understand
//               how to work with graphs in C++, and improve my skills with data structures and algorithms.
